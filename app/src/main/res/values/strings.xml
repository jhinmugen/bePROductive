    <string name="tips_first_tip">Using the most time of your morning can boost your productivity a lot. Think of waking up at 6 a.m. or earlier and of course sleep early your body needs all the energy you can provide it.
                                    Turn off all your electronic devices 90 minutes before you go to bed.</string>
    <string name="tips_second_tip">After waking up you should have a routine that you follow everyday. Don\'t hit the snooze button and stay offline for as long as you can. Do not forget your morning exercise and do not forget
                                    to socialize with the rest of your family members</string>
    <string name="tips_third_tip">Once you reach the office start with your most important task it may be tempting to do mindless work but it delays the rest of your important tasks. Also try to avoid chat responses or calls that may distract you from your work</string>
    <string name="tips_fourth_tip">If you want to boost your productivity levels you should really pay attention to your diet. Never neglect your breakfast and avoid lunch that may
                                    contain sugary foods or heavy calorie-ridden foods like burgers or fries. They may make you feel sleepy, weak and slow at work instead salads, almonds and salads will provide you the necessary energy that your body needs while staying healthy</string>
    <string name="tips_fifth_tip">Regular exercise can make a huge change on your productivity. Studies have shown that 30â€“60 minutes of exercise can boost your time management, your mental performance and the ability to meet deadlines</string>
    <string name="tips_sixth_tip">Review your progress each day and find ways to improve. The most productive people out there are those who are honest about what they\'re doing well and where they need to do better.</string>
    <string name="tips_seventh_tip">Stop your multitasking habit. Several studies have shown that people who multitask take 50% more time to complete a single task and make 50% more errors. Apparently 40% of our time
                                    when trying to multitask is wasted on switching between tasks</string>
    <string name="tips_eight_tip">Last but no least take BREAKS! Take breaks through the year as well during your work. Our brain need time to rest and recharge. A recharged brain is re-energized and more creative that leads to productivity
                                    Our recommendation? Use working intervals while at work and make full use of your vacation, disconnecting fully from work.</string>
